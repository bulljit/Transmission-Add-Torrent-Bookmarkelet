   Bookmarklet for Adding a Torrent File to Transmission from your Mobile Phone
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT THIS SOLUTION

This solution uses a Bookmarklet on your phone to send the URL of a Torrent to your remote Transmission client. Your Transmission client then downloads the file and then reports back to your phone with a success/failure message. The disadvantage of this solution is that it requires some files to be installed on your server. The advantage is that there is minimal bandwidth usage between your phone and Transmission (great for use over EDGE connections).

FEATURES

- Works on iPhone, Desktop Browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari). Other smartphones (Android etc.) should work - please let us know if they don't.
- Simple install of Bookmarklet from phone or desktop
- Provides feedback of success / failure when adding Torrents
- Works with Transmission remote username and password
- Support for Private Trackers

INSTALLATION

These instructions already assume that you have setup Transmission for web access, and setup the relevant port forwarding to ensure it is accessible from the Internet. More information on these steps can be found in the WIKI:

https://github.com/bulljit/Transmission-Add-Torrent-Bookmarkelet/wiki

To setup the bookmarklet:

  - Copy the server-side files to your Transmission/Web/ directory
    - web/fetchtorrent.html
    - web/installbmlet.html
    - web/images/graphics/bookmarklet/* (All images)
  
  - If using the native Mac OS X Transmission.app this should be located under "~/Applications/Transmission.app/Contents/Resources/web". You can access these folders by right-clicking on the Transmission.app icon and choosing 'Show Package Contents'.

  - Install the Bookmarklet on your phone:

Simple Method:

There is now a web page to install the bookmarklet for you. It works on the Mac as well as the iPhone or iPad. Just browse to the following page and follow the instructions:

http://yourserver.ip:port/transmission/web/installbmlet.html

(Replace 'yourserver.ip:port' with your server and port address)

Manual Method:

Modify the following bookmarklet by replacing "yourserver.ip:port" with your server's "public.ip:port" and add it to your iPhone

javascript:(function(){var%20serverAddress%20=%20%22yourserver.ip:port%22;var%20cookieString%20=%20document.cookie;var%20a=document.getElementsByTagName(%27a%27);for(var%20i=0,j=a.length;i<j;i++){var%20linkurl%20=%20a[i].href;a[i].setAttribute(%27target%27,%27_blank%27);a[i].setAttribute(%27href%27,%22http://%22%20+%20serverAddress%20+%20%22/transmission/web/fetchtorrent.html?torrentlink=%22%20+%20encodeURIComponent(linkurl)%20+%20%22&cs=%22%20+%20encodeURIComponent(cookieString));var%20img=document.createElement(%27img%27);img.setAttribute(%27class%27,%20%27new-window%27);img.setAttribute(%27src%27,%27data:image/gif;base64,%27+%27R0lGODlhEAAMALMLAL66tBISEjExMdTQyBoaGjs7OyUlJWZmZgAAAMzMzP///////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAA%27+%27ACH5BAEAAAsALAAAAAAQAAwAAAQ/cMlZqr2Tps13yVJBjOT4gYairqohCTDMsu4iHHgwr7UA/LqdopZS%27+%27DBBIpGG5lBQH0GgtU9xNJ9XZ1cnsNicRADs=%27);img.setAttribute(%27style%27,%27width:16px!important;height:12px!important;border:none!important;%27);a[i].appendChild(img);}})();

2. Once the page has loaded, open your bookmarks, and click the 'Download Torrent Remotely!' bookmark. 
3. Enter your Transmissions username and password if prompted. (See the known issues section on how to optionally have the bookmarklet do this for you.)
4. The page will be modified to add a 'new window' icon next to all the links on the page. 
5. Click the 'download' link of the Torrent that you want.

KNOWN ISSUES

- After Transmission auto-updates the server files need to be reinstalled

After Transmission installs an automatic updated the old version is moved to the Trash and the server files will need to be readded in the new version. There is no known workaround for this at this stage.

- If you have a username and password set for Transmission Remote Access, you will need to enter them each time you click the bookmarklet.

If you wish to avoid this you can add your username and password, together with your server address and port number to the bookmarklet code like so:

username:password@yourserver.ip:port

This is not really recommended since it means that your username and password are sent insecurely, but if you are willing to take the risk then your bookmarklet should look something like this:

javascript:(function(){var%20serverAddress%20=%20%22user:pass@yourserver.ip:port%22;var%20cookieString%20=%20document.cookie;var%20a=document.getElementsByTagName(%27a%27);for(var%20i=0,j=a.length;i<j;i++){var%20linkurl%20=%20a[i].href;a[i].setAttribute(%27target%27,%27_blank%27);a[i].setAttribute(%27href%27,%22http://%22%20+%20serverAddress%20+%20%22/transmission/web/fetchtorrent.html?torrentlink=%22%20+%20encodeURIComponent(linkurl)%20+%20%22&cs=%22%20+%20encodeURIComponent(cookieString));var%20img=document.createElement(%27img%27);img.setAttribute(%27class%27,%20%27new-window%27);img.setAttribute(%27src%27,%27data:image/gif;base64,%27+%27R0lGODlhEAAMALMLAL66tBISEjExMdTQyBoaGjs7OyUlJWZmZgAAAMzMzP///////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAA%27+%27ACH5BAEAAAsALAAAAAAQAAwAAAQ/cMlZqr2Tps13yVJBjOT4gYairqohCTDMsu4iHHgwr7UA/LqdopZS%27+%27DBBIpGG5lBQH0GgtU9xNJ9XZ1cnsNicRADs=%27);img.setAttribute(%27style%27,%27width:16px!important;height:12px!important;border:none!important;%27);a[i].appendChild(img);}})();
